/// Generates a translation using the OpenAI API through a QuickBlox user token and proxy URL.
///
/// Using a proxy server like the [QuickBlox AI Assistant Proxy Server](https:github.com/QuickBlox/qb-ai-assistant-proxy-server) offers significant benefits in terms of security and functionality:
///
/// Enhanced Security:
/// - When making direct requests to the OpenAI API from the client-side, sensitive information like API keys may be exposed. By using a proxy server, the API keys are securely stored on the server-side, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or potential breaches.
/// - The proxy server can implement access control mechanisms, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users with valid QuickBlox user tokens can access the OpenAI API. This adds an extra layer of security to the communication.
///
/// Protection of API Keys:
///  - Exposing API keys on the client-side could lead to misuse, abuse, or accidental exposure. A proxy server hides these keys from the client, mitigating the risk of API key exposure.
///  - Even if an attacker gains access to the client-side code, they cannot directly obtain the API keys, as they are kept confidential on the server.
///
///  Rate Limiting and Throttling:
///  - The proxy server can enforce rate limiting and throttling to control the number of requests made to the OpenAI API. This helps in complying with API usage policies and prevents excessive usage that might lead to temporary or permanent suspension of API access.
///
///  Request Logging and Monitoring:
///  - By using a proxy server, requests to the OpenAI API can be logged and monitored for auditing and debugging purposes. This provides insights into API usage patterns and helps detect any suspicious activities.
///
///  Flexibility and Customization:
///  - The proxy server acts as an intermediary, allowing developers to introduce custom functionalities, such as response caching, request modification, or adding custom headers. These customizations can be implemented without affecting the client-side code.
///
///  SSL/TLS Encryption:
///  - The proxy server can enforce SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission between the client and the server. This ensures that data remains encrypted and secure during communication.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - text: The text to be translated.
///   - qbToken: The QuickBlox user token used for proxy communication.
///   - urlPath: The proxy URL to be used for making the request to OpenAI.
///
/// - Throws: A `QBAIException` if an error occurs during the request or validation.
///
/// - Returns: The generated answer as a String.
